<!-- AutoSPInstaller Sample Configuration File
    General Instructions:
    1. If you use the characters ' " < > & in your configuration (e.g. in passwords) you should encode them as follows:

        '	&apos;
        "	&quot;
        <	&lt;
        >	&gt;
        &	&amp;
    
        For example <Password>Fd"je&f</Password> should be written <Password>Fd&quot;je&amp;f</Password>
    2. Configuration IS case sensitive.
    3. Use a validator like http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_validator.asp to check the syntax of your file.
    4. Any element that has a Provision="" attribute controls whether a particular component, site, or service is installed
       on a particular server. It can be set to either true to provision on every server on which the script is run,
       false to never provision, or to a list of computer names to provision the service only on the listed machines.
       This allows you to configure an entire multi-server farm with different servers fulfilling different roles
       using a single configuration file.
       e.g. <ExcelServices Provision="Server1 Server2"> would provision excel services only on Server1 and Server2. -->
